# Huntington's Disease Risk Assessment

What does it do?

"Huntington's Disease Risk Assessment", my CS50 final project, is a web page that analyzes sequenced DNA of the user and his partner to estimate the risk that their potential offspring will develop a severe neurodegenerative disease called the Huntington's disease.
A screencast demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/-1IZwtWN5e0.  

Why does it do it?

Although the Huntington's disease is heritable, its symptoms often become apparent in 30s and 40s. This means that young people in their 20s who are sick may not yet be aware of it and inadvertently pass the mutations to 
their children. Analyzing DNA before making reproductive decision is therefore useful.

How does it do it?

The program reads 4 .txt files uploaded by the user his own and his partner's sequenced DNA and then analyzes Exon 1 of the HTT gene, a region of the human genome that determines the disease outcome.
