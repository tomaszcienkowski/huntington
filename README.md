## Huntington's Disease Risk Assessment

* What does the program do?

*Huntington's Disease Risk Assessment*, my final project for CS50, is a web page that analyzes sequenced DNA of the user and his partner to estimate the risk that their potential offspring will develop a severe neurodegenerative disease called the Huntington's disease. A screencast demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/-1IZwtWN5e0.

* Why does it do it?

Although the Huntington's disease is heritable, its symptoms often become apparent in later stages of life (30s/ 40s). This means that young people in their 20s who are sick may not yet be aware of it and inadvertently pass the mutations to their children. Analyzing DNA before making any reproductive decisions is, therefore, strongly encouraged.

* How does it do it?

The program reads 4 *.txt* files uploaded by the user with his own and his partner's sequenced DNA and then analyzes Exon 1 of the HTT gene, a region of the human genome that determines the disease outcome, to estimate the probability of the disease developing in their potential offspring.
